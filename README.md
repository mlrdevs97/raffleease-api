## Introduction

Raffleease is a full-stack web application designed to streamline and modernize the management of raffles organized by animal rescue associations. Originally developed to address the specific needs of a local organization that had been handling its raffles entirely manually, the project aims to resolve common operational and administrative issues through digitalization.

The platform enables the creation and management of raffles, ticket reservations and sales, and provides full lifecycle control of customer orders‚Äîfrom initial creation to finalization. It also includes a robust user management system with role-based access control, allowing associations to assign different levels of responsibility to their members.

What began as a tailored solution for a single association has since evolved into a more flexible and scalable system, capable of supporting multiple organizations with similar goals. This document provides a comprehensive overview of the RESTful API exposed by the Raffleease server.

## Key Features

-   üß± **Multi-Tenant Architecture:** The application is designed to serve multiple organizations within a single instance. Tenancy is enforced by scoping most endpoints under the path /associations/{associationId}, which isolates data access and authorization within each organizational context.
-   üîê **JWT-Based Authentication with Refresh Tokens:** Authentication is implemented using stateless JWT access tokens. For security and session persistence, refresh tokens are delivered via HTTP-only, same-site, secure cookies, minimizing exposure to XSS attacks.
-   üõ°Ô∏è **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Authorization is enforced using Spring Security and aspect-oriented programming (AOP). Roles are defined per association, and each secured operation is guarded by role checks performed through custom annotations and interceptors.
-   ‚ôªÔ∏è **Centralized Error Handling:** All exceptions and validation errors are intercepted and processed by a global exception handler. Responses are returned in a consistent format that includes an HTTP status code, internal error code, and a structured payload.
-   üì¶ **Standardized API Response Format:** All endpoints follow a standardized response structure using a response factory pattern, ensuring consistency in success and error cases.
-   üö¶ **Rate Limiting:** The API includes route-level and user-level rate limiting, implemented via AOP and backed by Redis for distributed request tracking. When limits are exceeded, the system returns a 429 Too Many Requests response with appropriate headers.
-   üß† **Domain-Based Modular Architecture:** The backend is organized into bounded domains that encapsulate related logic, entities, and services, which improves scalability and enforces separation of concerns.
-   üîç **Search with Filtering, Sorting, and Pagination:** Search endpoints implement dynamic query generation using JPA CriteriaBuilder, allowing for flexible filtering, multi-field sorting, and paginated results.
-   üì¨ **Email Notification Integration:** The system integrates with third-party providers for sending transactional email notifications. The notification module is decoupled from business logic and supports multiple channels.
-   üñºÔ∏è **Filesystem-Based Media Handling:** Uploaded media is stored and managed on the filesystem with metadata tracking. The system handles file validation, path organization, and secure URL generation.
-   üß™ **Integration Testing with Testcontainers:** The application uses Testcontainers to run full-stack integration tests against real instances of services like PostgreSQL, ensuring high test fidelity and reproducible environments.
-   üîÅ **HTTP Filters and Interceptors:** Custom filters are used to log requests, sanitize headers, and manage token extraction. Interceptors manage audit trails and enrich security contexts.
-   üìÅ **Configuration via Environment Variables and Docker:** All sensitive or environment-specific settings are managed through environment variables. The application is fully containerized using Docker, with services orchestrated via Docker Compose for local development and deployment.

## Technology Stack

-   **Backend**: Java 17, Spring Boot 3
-   **Database**: PostgreSQL
-   **In-Memory Cache**: Redis (for rate limiting and session management)
-   **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose
-   **Testing**: JUnit 5, Mockito, Testcontainers

## Architecture & Design

The application is built on a modular, domain-driven architecture that emphasizes separation of concerns and scalability.

-   **Domain-Based Modules**: The backend is organized into bounded domains (e.g., Users, Orders, Raffles) that encapsulate related logic, entities, and services.
-   **Standardized API Responses**: A response factory pattern ensures all API responses (both success and error) follow a consistent and predictable structure.
-   **HTTP Filters and Interceptors**: Custom filters and interceptors handle cross-cutting concerns like request logging, audit trails, and security context enrichment.
-   **Configuration Management**: All sensitive or environment-specific settings are managed through environment variables, aligning with Twelve-Factor App principles.

## Database Schema

The data model is designed to support the multi-tenant architecture and complex relationships between raffles, users, and orders.
